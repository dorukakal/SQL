# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle via https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021?select=spotify_top50_2021.csv

# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into. 
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 

SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability), AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity

SELECT distinct artist_name AS artist, SUM(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist
ORDER BY SUM(popularity) DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Later on, I calculated the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table.
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above,
showed their name, their average popularity, and label them as 'Top Star' and order them by highest popularity score */
 
WITH avg_pop_CTE AS (
    SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity) as avg_popularity
    FROM Spotifydata s
    GROUP BY s.artist_name
    )
    SELECT artist_name, avg_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
    FROM avg_pop_CTE
    WHERE avg_popularity >= 90
    ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC;
